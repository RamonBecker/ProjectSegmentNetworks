# Reliable Data Transfer Algorithm
> Project was developed as a simulation of reliable data transfer or reliable segment delivery.

## :information_source: Information 

Reliable data transfer protocol is done on a reliable channel, but it has the network layer below it: an unreliable channel. For example, TCP is a reliable data transfer protocol implemented over an untrusted end-to-end network layer (IP).

## :zap: Technologies	

- Java


## :memo: Developed features

- [x] Checksum to detect errors
- [x]  Acknowledgments (ACKs): receiver explicitly notifies the sender that the packet has been received correctly
- [x]  Negative acknowledgments (NAKs): receiver explicitly notifies the transmitter that the packet has errors
- [x]  Transmitter resends the packet upon receipt of a NAK
- [x]  Transmitter adds sequence number to each packet
- [x] Transmitter resends the last packet if ACK / NAK is lost
- [x] Receiver discards (does not pass to the application) duplicate packets
